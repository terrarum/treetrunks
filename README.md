## Build Setup

``` bash

npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Plan

## Notes
* All auth/vuex interaction is handled by onAuthStateChanged, but might need to reinstate individual functions for login versus registration so that accurate feedback can be given to the user about successful/unsuccessful registration/login.
